# Mojo as a web framework

The idea is that it serves in:
- [ ] C/C++
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Rust

> [!NOTE]
> At least if I don't succeed, don't tell yourself not to try. This terrible task was imposed by one of the CEOs of BetterCampus :(

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a miracle happens and the goal is achieved, you will not be given any future support, please note that Mojo is still in development and this, under the theory that it works, can stop working at any time
